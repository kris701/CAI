# Wires
Almost all cables in the project, consist of either 2 or 3 inner wires. (With the exception of the 7-pin cable for the front panel)

# Terminals
There are some different setups, for different terminals. But in general, they are intented to have the same setup

All in all there are 3 different 3-proned terminals from the main controller:
## Base

### Two proned wires
There are also some wires and terminals, that only use two terminals (usually from a module to the thing being controlled, e.g. from a Transistor Module to LEDs)
They are esentially no different than the Base terminal, except there are no Signal:
