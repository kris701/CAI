# Centralised Auxiliary Interface (CAI)

A project about centralizing a lot of the auxiliary systems for my 3D printer.
As well as add some new systems, like auto-screws, that makes the operation of the printer a lot easier!
It is also designed to be mounted on my [toolhead extension project](https://github.com/kris701/SnapMaker-Toolhead-Extensions).

### Auto-Screws
Automatic screws to take heatbed and toolhead off and on, to make it significantly easier to switch between CNC, Laser engraver and 3D-printer!

### Auto-Setup
Single menu item, to setup all thats needed for CNC or 3D print.
Consisting of tightening screws, turning on LED and for 3D printing, turn on the nozzle blower.
